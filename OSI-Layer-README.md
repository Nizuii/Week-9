# What is OSI Model

- An OSI model is a conceptual standardized framework developed by **IOS (International Organization for Standardization.)** designed to understand the flow of network, to organise the protocol order.
- However TCP is not implemented in practical system but it is a theoretical framework used to understand the working flow of network.

## Layers of OSI Model.

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**: Handles the physical transmission of raw data bits over a medium. (Such as cables or wireless signals.)
2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**: Packages raw bits into frames & manages error detection & correction between directly connected nodes.
3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**: Handles routing & forwarding of packets across different networks
