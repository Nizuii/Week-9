<img src="images/UDP-gif.gif">

- **UDP** stands for User Datagram Protocol.
- UDP Ensures:

  - No handshake.
  - No reliability.
  - No retransmission.
  - Just sends packets blindly.

Because of this:
- Its much faster than TCP
- But not reliable as TCP

## What is UDP used for

Anywhere where speed is important than accuracy.

- Video streaming
- Online gaming
- VoIP calls
- DNS Lookups
- DHCP

If 1 frame or 1 voice packet is lost user won't notice.

## cybersecurity relevance
